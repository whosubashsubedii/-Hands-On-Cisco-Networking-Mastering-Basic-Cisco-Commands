## 💡 Learning Highlights

This project reinforced my understanding of:
- Command-line-based network configuration
- Layer 2 & Layer 3 device behavior
- The role of VLANs and routing in network segmentation and connectivity
- Secure device management practices

It serves as a **solid stepping stone** toward more advanced networking concepts including dynamic routing, ACLs, NAT, and more.
